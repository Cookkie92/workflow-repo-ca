## Testing

Unit Tests (Vitest)
The project uses Vitest to test specific functions:

Test Cases:
isActivePath function:

Returns true when the current path matches the href exactly.
Returns true for the root path (/) when the path is / or /index.html.
Returns true when the current path includes the href.
Returns false when paths donâ€™t match.
getUserName function:

Returns the name from the user object stored in local storage.
Returns null when no user exists in local storage.

# Run Vitest tests using:

npm run test

# For a better UI experience:

npm run test:ui

# End-to-End Tests (Playwright)

The project uses Playwright to simulate user interactions and verify UI workflows.

Test Cases:
Login Test:

User successfully logs in with valid credentials (from .env).
Displays an error message with invalid credentials.
Navigation Test:

Navigates to the home page.
Waits for the venue list to load.
Clicks the first venue.
Verifies that the "Venue details" page loads with the heading "Venue details."

# Run Playwright tests using:

npx playwright test

# Environment Variables

The following variables must be defined in an .env file for the project to function correctly:

VITE_LOGIN_USERNAME=your-username  
VITE_LOGIN_PASSWORD=your-password  
Ensure the .env file is included in .gitignore to protect sensitive information. An example configuration is provided in .env.example.

# Code Formatting & Linting

ESLint: Enforces code quality and best practices for JavaScript.
Prettier: Formats code to maintain consistent style.
Git Hooks
Pre-commit hooks ensure all code is linted and formatted before commits:

JavaScript files: Automatically formatted with Prettier and linted with ESLint.
HTML files: Automatically formatted with Prettier.
Commits will fail if the code does not adhere to the style guide. Fix issues before committing.
